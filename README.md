## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing parallel auto-parking for a car using a set of components and sensors. The code and hardware work together to enable the car to autonomously park in parallel parking spaces.


## Contributors

 AVELABS Group 1 under the supervision of:
* Dr mohamed Zorkany.  
* Dr mahmoud hussein.


Team members are five Embedded Software Engineers at NTI Autmotive Professional Track:
* Ahmed Saber.
* Lara Ramy.
* Mohammed Aboelniel.
* Mohammed Haitham.
* Yomna Ahmed.



## Components

The project utilizes the following components:

- Small Car Kit
- Ultra-sonic Sensors "HC-SR04"
- DC Motors
- H-Bridge "L298N"
- Tiva C TM4C123GH6PM
- Motor Driver L298n
- V. Regulator L7805CV




## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammedaboelneal/Parallel-Auto-Parking-Car.git
   ```

2. Connect the components to your hardware according to the project requirements.

3. Build and flash the project onto your hardware.


## Functionality

The core functionality of this project includes:

- Measuring distances using the HC-SR04 ultra-sonic sensors.
- Implementing auto-parking logic to find a suitable parking spot.
- Maneuvering the car into a parallel parking space autonomously.
